#    $ python3 server.py [-p serv_port] server
#    $ python3 client.py get [-p serv_port] server remote_file [local_file]
#    $ python3 client.py put [-p serv_port] server local_file [remote_file]


# Successfully tested on the following platforms:
#    - Windows 10 22H2 with Python 3.12.1
#    - Linux Mint 21.2 with Python 3.12.1
